        <p>PUG is an acronym for '<b>P</b>ick <b>U</b>p <b>G</b>ame'. It's a casual but organised game of <BR/>'capture the flag' in <a href="https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/">Tribes: Ascend</a> consisting of 2 teams of 7-9 players.</p>
        <p>Each team is picked by a captain who picks players based on their prefered role (such as flag capper, flag defence etc).</p>
        <p>The teams then play each other on a private server, making heavy use of voice communication to coordinate the offence and enforce the defence.</p>
        <p>This coordination leads to intense, fast-paced and <i>clutch</i> play, <BR/>which leads to some <span class="emphasis">ridiculously fun</span> times.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="header2">
        <h2 class="header">Sounds good, but who can play?</h2>

      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        <p>You can! The only requirements to play a pug is to have a mic for voice chat, and to be willing to work as part of a team.</p>
        <p>There is no minimum level requirement to play. As long as you have a good understanding of how the game works, you'll be able to help your team. If you are still concerned about this then use level 15 as a marker that you are pug ready!</p>
        <p>One small exception is capping. It would be best if you only roled a capper if you had at least 1 fast route (250+ km/h) per team per competitive map. If you'd like to learn new routes, check out <a href="http://playapug.com/roles#capping">the cappers section</a> of the roles page.</p>

      <div class="para1">
        <p>Don't worry about it, we get newcomers everyday! If you have any questions feel free to ask and someone online should help you out.</p>
        <p>There are also "newblood" pugs, which are a pugs specifically aimed at new players. These pugs are a mix of new players and experienced players with the purpose of helping people get to grips with a comp style of play. They are a brand new feature and are happening every day, so if you are concerned then this is definitely something to take advantage of!</p>
        <p>And remember, if you're new to pugs or tribes, just let people know! We are very receptive to new players, and saying you are new lets captains pick teams that ensure you're not left on your own in a game or given too much responsibility.</p>

        <p>The PUG channel will probably the one with 'PUG' in the title, and is likely to have the most people. Inside the PUG channel there should a 'roles' subchannel which is where you join the role you want to play.</p>
        <p>There may also be a 'Played previous game' subchannel where you join just after playing a game. This is so the people who did not get to play get picked first for the next game.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis2">Finally</span> you wait for a game!</p>
        <p>Games will usually happen if there are 14 people in roles. Captains' sometimes volunteer, but regulars are often "coerced" into being captain to get the game going.</p>
        <p>When you hear your name being picked, join the server channel for your team (check what channel your captain is in to see what server and team). The easiest way to join the server is to add someone playing as a friend, and follow them in. The server password is usually in the server comment (see image), otherwise just ask.</p>
        <p style="font-size:.8em">P.S. While you're waiting, it might be a good idea to check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qr-KoeK3ko&t=0m28s">2 minute introduction</a> to competitive tribes.

        <h1>What comes after pugs?</h1>
    </div></center>
        <div class="para1" >
          <p>After you've played a few pugs, you should start to get a good idea of what's happening. Maybe you start wishing timings were better or that your team had more communication, or that every game could be like "that amazing game a while back where everyone was in sync and things just worked".</p>
          <p>Tribes is not a singleplayer game, it is a team game. After you are confident in your own abilities, it's time to start working with other players to improve your teamwork, which is the most crucial aspect of tribes. When you play as part of a team, every game is played with the purpose of improving the team, not just yourself. Having players in mid ready to pick up a punted flag, having precision timings between your offence taking out the sniper and crashing the stand before your cappers comes in, and always having someone there to support you are some of the benefits of having a team that make it so much more than playing with a new group in a pug.</p>
          <p>So how do you join a team then? Well, it just so happens now is the perfect time to be joining a team. There are a huge amount of newblood (new) teams popping up that are creating a lot of activity in the tribes community. Thanks to the support of <a href="http://sandboxclan.net">sandboxclan.net</a> it's easier than ever to find a team to play with. You can still (and are recommended to) join pugs, demonstrate your abilities, get to know players and join or create a team. But now there is also the <a href="http://sandboxclan.net/teams.php">recruitment section</a> section of sandboxclan where you can find teams that are recruiting or create your own team and have players join you!</p>
          <p>And to accommodate all these new players, there is also a "newblood" tournnament starting soon. It is designed for new players, and offers servers, referees, resources to join a team and mentoring to help your group or your specific role. It is a massive community effort, and every resource will be offered to the teams who are playing, especially those just getting started.</p>
          <p>These are just some of the tools available to you. Join a team and join a higher level of tribes, improving yourself as well as meeting and making friends with a large amount of great players and community vets. </p>
