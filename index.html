          <p>PUG is an acronym for '<b>P</b>ick <b>U</b>p <b>G</b>ame'. It's a casual but organised game of <BR/>'capture the flag' in <a href="https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/"><font color="red"><b>Tribes: Ascend</b></font></a> consisting of 2 teams of 7-9 players</p>
          <p>Each team is picked by a captain who picks players based on their prefered role (such as capper, heavy on flag etc)</p>
          <p>The teams then play each other on a private server, making heavy use of voice communication to coordinate the offence and enforce the defence</p>
          <p>This coordination leads to intense, fast-paced and <i>clutch</i> play, <BR/>which leads to some <span class="emphasis">ridiculously fun</span> times</p>

          <h2 class="header">Sounds good, but who can play?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <p>You can! The only requirements to play a pug is to have a mic for voice chat, and to be willing to work as a team.</p>
          <p>There is also no level minimum requirement to play. As long as you have a good understanding of how the game works, you'll be able to help your team. If you are still concerned about this then use level 12 as a marker that you are pug ready!</p>

        <div class="header2">
          <h2 class="header">It still sounds a little intimidating..</h2>

        <div class="para">
          <p>Don't worry about it, we get newcomers everyday! If you have any questions at all feel free to ask and someone online should help you out.</p>
          <p>If you're new to pugs or tribes, just let people know! This way they can put you in a 'less crucial' role to let you get to grips with pugging</p>
